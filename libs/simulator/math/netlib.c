*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGETRF computes an LU factorization of a general M-by-N matrix A
*  using partial pivoting with row interchanges.
*
*  The factorization has the form
*     A = P * L * U
*  where P is a permutation matrix, L is lower triangular with unit
*  diagonal elements (lower trapezoidal if m > n), and U is upper
*  triangular (upper trapezoidal if m < n).
*
*  This is the right-looking Level 3 BLAS version of the algorithm.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the M-by-N matrix to be factored.
*          On exit, the factors L and U from the factorization
*          A = P*L*U; the unit diagonal elements of L are not stored.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*
*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (min(M,N))
*          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= min(M,N), row i of the
*          matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero. The factorization
*                has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
*                singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
*                to solve a system of equations.

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DGETRI computes the inverse of a matrix using the LU factorization
*  computed by DGETRF.
*
*  This method inverts U and then computes inv(A) by solving the system
*  inv(A)*L = inv(U) for inv(A).
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the factors L and U from the factorization
*          A = P*L*U as computed by DGETRF.
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the inverse of the original matrix A.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          The pivot indices from DGETRF; for 1<=i<=N, row i of the
*          matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO=0, then WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,N).
*          For optimal performance LWORK >= N*NB, where NB is
*          the optimal blocksize returned by ILAENV.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error

*          > 0:  if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero; the matrix is
*                singular and its inverse could not be computed.

* SYNOPSIS:
*
* double x, y, erf();
*
* y = erf( x );
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*
* The integral is
*
*                           x
*                            -
*                 2         | |          2
*   erf(x)  =  --------     |    exp( - t  ) dt.
*              sqrt(pi)   | |
*                          -
*                           0
*
* The magnitude of x is limited to 9.231948545 for DEC
* arithmetic; 1 or -1 is returned outside this range.
*
* For 0 <= |x| < 1, erf(x) = x * P4(x**2)/Q5(x**2); otherwise
* erf(x) = 1 - erfc(x).
*
* ACCURACY:
*
*                      Relative error:
* arithmetic   domain     # trials      peak         rms
